Project Overview

This repository contains a pet project focused on email ham/spam detection. It utilizes both baseline machine learning models and large language models (LLMs) to achieve this goal. 

This project explores various approaches to classify emails and provides insights into the effectiveness of different methods.

Features

* Baseline Models: Implementations of traditional machine learning models for spam detection, such as:
    * Naive Bayes
    * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    * Random Forest and etc.
* LLM Integration: Exploration of utilizing LLMs for enhanced spam detection, including:
    * Fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on email data
    * Utilizing LLMs for feature extraction or augmentation

### UNDER CONSTRUCTION (as .ipynb too)
* Comparative Analysis: Evaluation and comparison of the performance of different models on a benchmark email dataset. 
* Data Preprocessing: Implementation of techniques for cleaning and preparing email data for model training.
* Visualization: Visualization of results and analysis to understand model performance and behavior.
